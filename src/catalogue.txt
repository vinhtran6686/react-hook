This is React Hook learning project implemented by VinhTran!
How it works is based on the file numbered below and you must change link of the "App" component in index.js file to run each example.
1. useRef (app.js)
2. useEffect
     2.1 App.js ( learn lifecycle of useEffect)
     2.2 Example2.js (get API with async await)
     2.3 Example3.js (callback & callback hell)
     2.4 Example4.js (promise & promise hell)
     2.5 Example5.js (Async await)
